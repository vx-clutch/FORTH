Chapter 1 Introduction

This is a general introduction to the FORTH REPL.
 
1.1 About

I built this implementation of the FORTH programming language becuase it is the
thing you build while learning how to create interpreters, compilers, and in
this case, REPL's.

1.1.2 Language Specification

The vFORTH language is a dialect of the FORTH language, but we will refer to it as FORTH. The main language
directives are placing items on the stack, operating on the stack, and
defining words. An item is any value on the stack . The stack is a
first in last out data structure. Any operations done to the stack are done
to the top item(s) of the stack, subsequent items cannot be accessed.

Items can be placed on the stack in a few ways. The most basic way is to
just any number â„¤ into the REPL.
